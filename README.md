# Neural Network Experiments

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks exploring progressively
more complex neural‑network architectures built from scratch.

## Contents

### 1. `singleLayer.ipynb`

A minimal single‑layer neural network.\
It demonstrates the structure of a first neural layer and highlights
that no weights were initialized in this early prototype.

### 2. `binaryClassification.ipynb`

A neural network designed for binary classification.\
The notebook builds a simple model capable of distinguishing between two
handwritten‑digit classes.

### 3. `multiclass.ipynb`

An extended version of the model for multiclass classification.\
Although the notebook contains no initial markdown, it represents the
next step beyond binary classification, scaling the architecture to
handle multiple classes.

## Getting Started

Open any notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells top‑to‑bottom.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   NumPy
-   Jupyter Notebook

## Project Goal

These notebooks document the progression from a single‑layer network to
full multiclass classification, providing a learning path for building
neural networks without high‑level frameworks.
